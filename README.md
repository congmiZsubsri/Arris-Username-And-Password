# Arris Username And Password
 
 
Hi all,

I just bought a new SB8200 from Amazon and performed a factory reset. When I access the modem remotely I'm not prompted for any login credentials and I see no options to add them. According to Arris I should be prompted for a username and password ( \_FAQs/SB8200-Web-Manager-Access).

I think it is a little unsecure in that someone on your wifi can interupt service for a short perior by browsing to the modem's admin page and resetting the device. Other than that I don't see any security holes. You could block access to this IP using firewall rules on some routers, (this is straight forward to do on my pfSense router!).
 
I have experieced the same no login page as everyone else on my SB8200. But today I was trying to check my signal levels and am now hitting a login page. But nothing I have tried has worked. Arris says the default for this device is Username = "admin" Password = "password".
 
When attempting to access the SVG2482AC Web Manager, the SVG2482AC prompts for an admin username and password. By default, the username is **admin**, and the password is **password**. If the SVG2482AC is using the default password, it will prompt to change it. For network security purposes, ARRIS recommends changing the default admin password. The link below shows how to change the default admin password.
 
If you use an Arris modem or router to connect to the internet, you may need to get into its configuration menu from time to time. You can usually do this with a username and password, and if you don't know the username and password, you can try the Arris default login settings. If you have trouble getting into your router, contact your internet service provider for help.
 
Arris makes a variety of modems and wireless routers that you can use to connect to your internet service provider. In some cases, you may own your Arris device, but it others, your internet service provider may rent the router to you.
 
Either way, if you have trouble with your device or need to change the wireless or other settings, you need to connect to the device. Typically, you can do this by accessing the device through your wireless or wired home network by connecting to its IP address, Simply enter that address into the address bar on your browser, whether on your computer, phone or tablet.

When you connect, you are usually prompted to enter a username and password. If you haven't changed your Arris modem login settings, try using the Arris default password and username. The default username is "admin," and the Arris default password is "password." After you connect, you can change a variety of settings depending on your Arris device model, often including passwords, wireless connection settings and other information. If you're not sure what value to use for any particular setting, contact your internet service provider for help or consult your device's manual.
 
If you are having trouble with your Arris router and can't find a proper setting to fix it, or you don't know the Arris modem login information for your device and think it may have been changed, reset the device to factory settings. You usually do this by pressing and holding the reset button on the back of the modem for about 15 seconds. This resets all the default settings, including passwords, which may solve your problem or make it easier for you to log in to the device.

It is well known that a default password is a standard pre-configured passcode for any device. Such unchanged default configurations can be very risky for your device. Typical default passwords are guest, admin, sysadmin, etc. To say more, sellers as a rule apply a single default passcode. It is the main problem because it can be easily found online.
 
They are widely applied in embedded systems, remote terminal interfaces, and industrial control systems. If you leave them unchanged, your business and home network can be an easy target for attackers.

A strong password is extremely important. It can avert unauthorized access to your devices and accounts. If your passcode is long and complicated, it will be difficult for hackers to crack it.

That is why it is so crucial to take care of your passwords.

I am hoping somebody who reads this has cURL'd into an SB8200 cable modem (or similar) with user/pw authentication and can just post the details. More likely will be many suggestions of things to try and some google result links, most of which I likely tried already. What would be most helpful to start I think is troubleshooting why I cannot get a successful login and the credential cookie set on my initial cURL.
 
BTW - The username and password are known to me, were set by me, and work fine to login from a browser. I think no matter how I have passed in the credentials I am just being returned the login form again. Maybe basic auth will never work and I need to do something else.
 
EDIT: I discovered the "Preserve Log" option in Chrome dev tools. This allowed me to copy as curl both the login and the redirect actions. And running the login curl (which does use basic auth) does return me on stdout a credential cookie. I was not able to get this cookie stored in my cookies.txt file using the cookie options in curl. And immediately using the returned cookie in the redirect curl does not get me the expected results and instead returns the login page. But I am getting closer.
 
Solved it myself. Once I was able to save the login as curl in chrome, things fell in place. Looks like I was missing some required curl options in my initial attempts. I still need to skinny this down to the minimal necessary options, eliminate the double copy of user/pw chrome encoded, and add error checking. But the following will successfully login and pull modem status for an Arris SB8200. Never did get curl to store the credential cookie in a cookies.txt file so just used a local shell variable.
 
(Perhaps its app would have simplified the set-up. We shall never know. I actually installed it on my Teracube 2e, which is no longer my daily-driver phone. It wanted me to make an online account and I decided that I did not need an online account for my modem.)
 
I doubted that I would have much to do after signing into my modem. In order to access my modem directly, one would need to be connected to my internet But I still decided it would be best to change the default username and password. To be sure, it is possible that I could not do better than the super secure default admin/password username/password combination, but there is no harm in trying.
 
I fully expected to login to my modem with the modem-provided credentials. However, my hopes were dashed when the modem rejected my login. I tried once or twice more thinking there must be a mistake. But not only was I unable to log-in, the modem informed me that I would have to wait five minutes before making another attempt.
 
Once I was logged in, the modem prompted me to pick a new password. The new password had to be between 8-20 characters and have at least one upper case and lower case letter, one number, and one special character. Having learned my lesson about how passwords can be finicky, I opted to use diceware to generate a three-word password and then add one number and punctuation manually. It took two tries to get a password less than 20 characters. The modem accepted my password.
 
Sure enough, there was very little to do in the modem UI. There is a single toggle for enabling link aggregation set-up which I left off (I do not know the use-case as of the moment I am writing this). Having changed the password, I logged out of the modem.
